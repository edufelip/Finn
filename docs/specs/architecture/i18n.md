# Internationalization (i18n) Specification

## Purpose
Provides a centralized mechanism for managing multi-language support and dynamic string formatting.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR-I18N-01**: The system shall provide a way to translate keys into the current locale's strings.
- **FR-I18N-02**: The system shall support variable interpolation in translation strings.
- **FR-I18N-03**: The system shall support retrieving lists of strings.

## Use Cases
### UC-I18N-01: Display Interpolated String
1. UI component requests translation for `post.postedBy` with `{ name: 'John' }`.
2. System replaces `{name}` in the string `"Posted by {name}"`.
3. UI displays "Posted by John".

## Test Cases
- **TC-I18N-01**: Verify that if a translation key is missing, the system returns the key itself as a fallback.
- **TC-I18N-02**: Verify that string lists (e.g., suggested topics) are correctly retrieved as arrays.

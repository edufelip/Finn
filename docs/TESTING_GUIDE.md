## 🧪 Manual Test Plan (UGC Precautions + Moderation)

### Prerequisites
1. Apply migrations (`supabase db push` or your deployment flow).
2. Prepare accounts: **Admin/Owner**, **Staff**, **Regular User**, **Guest**.
3. Bootstrap the first admin role via SQL (only needed once):
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = <admin_user_id>;
   ```
4. From **Settings → Admin tools**, set the **Staff** account role to `staff`.
5. Create a moderated community owned by the Admin/Owner.

### 1) Terms/EULA Acceptance Gate
1. Sign in as the Regular User.
2. Confirm the Terms screen appears before any feeds.
3. Tap the terms link and verify it opens the EULA URL in the in-app webview.
4. Accept the terms.
5. Relaunch the app; Terms screen should no longer appear.
6. Verify in DB:
   ```sql
   SELECT terms_version, terms_accepted_at FROM profiles WHERE id = <user_id>;
   ```
**Expected:** `terms_version` and `terms_accepted_at` are populated.

### 2) Text Filtering & Image Review
1. As Regular User, create a post in the moderated community with text containing a review term (e.g., “spam” or “nsfw”).
2. Confirm the post is created with **pending** moderation and you see the pending alert.
3. Create another post with an image (safe content) as Regular User.
4. Confirm the image post is **pending** moderation.
**Expected:** Non-moderator image posts and flagged text posts require review; moderators/owners bypass.

### 3) User Blocking → Auto Report
1. As Regular User, open a post by another user.
2. Tap the 3‑dot menu → **Block User** and enter a 15+ character reason.
3. Confirm the blocked user’s posts disappear immediately from feeds.
4. Open a post detail for the blocked user; verify blocked-state UI appears.
5. Verify a report was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM post_reports WHERE user_id = <blocker_id> ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
**Expected:** `user_blocks` row created and a `post_reports` row created for the source post.

### 4) Reporting Queue + 24‑Hour SLA Labels
1. As Regular User, report a post with a 15+ character reason.
2. As Admin/Owner, open **Community Settings → Reported Content**.
3. Confirm the report card displays a **Due in Xh** label.
4. (Optional) Set the report time back 25+ hours to validate **Overdue**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE post_reports SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '25 hours' WHERE id = <report_id>;
   ```
5. Reload Reported Content and verify the label shows **Overdue**.

### 5) Remove & Ban (Community / Global)
1. From **Reported Content**, choose a report.
2. Tap **Remove & Ban User**.
3. Select **Community ban**.
4. Verify:
   - Post is deleted.
   - Report status becomes `resolved_deleted`.
   - Community ban record exists.
5. Repeat and select **Global ban** (staff/admin only).
**Expected:** Community bans block posting/commenting in that community; global bans remove profile/communities everywhere.

### 6) Global Ban / Unban via Admin Tools
1. As Staff, open **Settings → Admin tools**.
2. Use **Global ban user** with a target user ID.
3. Verify the user appears in `user_bans`:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_bans WHERE user_id = <banned_user_id>;
   ```
4. Sign in as the banned user.
5. Confirm the **Banned Account** screen appears and feeds are inaccessible.
6. As Staff, remove the global ban and verify the user can access again.

### 7) Admin Role Management
1. As Admin, open **Settings → Admin tools → Set user role**.
2. Promote a user to **staff**, then to **admin**.
3. Confirm the promoted user now sees Admin tools.
4. Verify Staff cannot set roles (admin only).
**Expected:** Only admins can change roles; staff can ban/unban but cannot set roles.

## 🔍 Data Verification

### Check Database Records

After completing test scenarios, verify in Supabase dashboard:

#### 1. community_moderators table
```sql
SELECT * FROM community_moderators 
WHERE community_id = <test_community_id>;
```
**Expected:** Rows for added moderators (or empty if removed)

#### 2. moderation_logs table
```sql
SELECT * FROM moderation_logs 
WHERE community_id = <test_community_id>
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
**Expected:** All actions logged:
- settings_changed
- moderator_added
- moderator_removed
- approve_post
- mark_safe
- mark_for_review

#### 3. posts table (moderation_status)
```sql
SELECT id, content, moderation_status 
FROM posts 
WHERE community_id = <test_community_id>;
```
**Expected:**
- Approved posts: `moderation_status = 'approved'`
- Pending posts: `moderation_status = 'pending'`
- Rejected posts: `moderation_status = 'rejected'`

#### 4. post_reports table
```sql
SELECT * FROM post_reports 
WHERE post_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM posts WHERE community_id = <test_community_id>
);
```
**Expected:**
- New reports: `status = 'pending'`
- Handled reports: `status = 'resolved_safe'` or `status = 'resolved_deleted'`

#### 5. user_bans table
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_bans WHERE user_id = <banned_user_id>;
```
**Expected:**
- Row exists after global ban action

#### 6. user_blocks table
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_blocks WHERE blocker_id = <user_id>;
```
**Expected:**
- Row exists after blocking a user

#### 7. profiles role
```sql
SELECT id, role FROM profiles WHERE id IN (<admin_id>, <staff_id>);
```
**Expected:**
- Role values reflect Admin/Staff assignments

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Not Authorized" on all screens
**Cause:** RLS policies not applied or user not logged in  
**Solution:**
1. Verify migrations applied: `supabase db push`
2. Check user is logged in with valid session
3. Verify community owner_id matches user ID

### Issue 2: Badge counts show 0 when posts exist
**Cause:** Repository method not filtering correctly  
**Solution:**
1. Check `getPendingPosts()` filters by `moderation_status = 'pending'`
2. Check `getReportsByStatus()` filters correctly
3. Verify RLS policies allow reading

### Issue 3: Post doesn't appear after approval
**Cause:** Frontend cache not updated  
**Solution:**
1. Check `setCommunityPosts()` called after approval
2. Verify optimistic UI update logic
3. Try refreshing feed manually

### Issue 4: Moderation log not created
**Cause:** createLog() not called or fails silently  
**Solution:**
1. Add try-catch around log creation
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify user has permission to insert

### Issue 5: "Mark for Review" visible to non-mods
**Cause:** canModerate prop not passed correctly  
**Solution:**
1. Verify `canModerate` state updated in CommunityDetailScreen
2. Check prop passed to PostCard correctly
3. Verify isModerator() check works
